<h2 id="content">Who we are</h2>
<p>The Sustainable Mobility team of Cornell University Sustainable Design, formally Bus Shelter Renovations, is focused on redesigning public transportation in Tompkins County. We comprise of students from all seven colleges of Cornell University and are partnering with the Tompkins Consolidated Area Transit, TCAT, to develop a more systematic approach for urban-to-rural public transportation. As part of this systematic change, we utilize systems design thinking to understand and best serve the needs of our stakeholders. <br><br>
The systems design thinking process is anchored in three main methods of data collection: inspiration, fact-finding, and empathy fieldwork. The goal of this process is to become immersed in the problem space, so as to develop innovative solutions that best meet the needs of the stakeholders. Throughout this process, there is continuous iteration and testing—ensuring the final recommendations are tailored for the community. We interface all facets of our project with systems engineering practices to develop a complete grasp of the external system context and internal system interfaces. This allows for a thorough and well-documented approach to traditional engineering practices and a greater understanding of our solution space.
