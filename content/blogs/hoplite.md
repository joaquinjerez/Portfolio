<h2 id="content">Our goal</h2>
<p>Two Cornell Engineers and I got together September 2019 and set out to build a venture that would save people's lives. We conducted months of empathy fieldwork to find how we could best apply our skills to achieve that goal.</p>

<h2 id="content">Problem</h2>
<p>Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA) is the leading cause of death in America, killing around 325,000 people every year.  This leads to many deaths because you only have about 10 minutes to receive treatment via an automated external defibrillator (AED) before your survival rate drops to zero.  Ambulance response times vary around the country, but are particularly bad in rural areas, where it might take up to 30 minutes for a paramedic to arrive with an AED.  We aim to solve the problem of transporting an AED to anyone, anywhere, before that ten minute mark occurs.
</p>
<h2 id="content">Solution</h2>
<p>In order to deliver an AED to someone in cardiac arrest as soon as possible, we have designed a drone equipped with a payload mechanism that will be able to travel to a 911 caller in a fraction of the amount of time it would take an ambulance to get there.  The top requirement is speed, so our drone is a hybrid between a traditional quadcopter and an RC plane.  The combination of these designs will make our drone lightweight, energy efficient, and extremely fast, reaching speeds of up to 100 mph.  We envision our product being used in the following manner:

    <h2 id="content">VTOL Hybrid Fixed Wing</h2>
    <p>The advantages UAVs have over the transportation options today is the ability to get from point A to point B in a straight line quickly, efficiently, and autonomously. There are two established types of UAVs to consider, VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) drones, and fixed wing drones, each having their own advantages. The third type is a hybrid between both fixed wing drones and quadcopters. </p>
