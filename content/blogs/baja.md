<h1 id="content">Who we are</h1>
<p>In my freshmen year at Cornell, I applied for the Cornell Baja Racing team. In my first semester, I joined the brakes team. </p>
    <blockquote>"Cornell Baja SAE Racing is an engineering project team which annually designs, builds and races an off-road vehicle to compete in the SAE Collegiate Baja Design Series. By encouraging hands-on engineering and project-based learning, Cornell Baja takes engineering out of the classroom (and onto the track) for 40 students annually. Each year, our research moves through 3 stages of review before our design is finalized: Preliminary Review, Critical Review, and Final Review. During this time, we’re also modifying our older cars, so we can test new designs on prior years’ vehicles. Following our final review, we move to our build phase. Each year, we continue to innovate and improve—redesigning even the smallest components. We balance hard work with a passion for our car, and we think that passion really makes the difference. The competition requires students to balance design and cost with dynamic performance while following a strict set of safety guidelines and standardized rules. There are three North American competitions annually, each with 100 competing teams. The competition is broken down into static and dynamic events."</blockquote>

            <h3>My Projects</h3>
            <p>While on the team, I worked on a variety of stuff ranging from designing and manufacturing the master cylinders, brake lever, brake rotors, costum callipers, and most excitingly, the cutting brakes and differential unlocker. </p>

                <h3>Cutting Brakes</h3>
                <p>In order to reduce our turning radius in order to decrease our time during the competition, we implemented cutting brakes on our car from 2016 to 2018. Cutting brakes allow the driver to actuate a single rear calliper before entering a turn, causing the car to perform a hairpin turn. We were the only team out of 150 other teams to incorporate this technology due to the increased complexity in the gear box. The most innovative part of our design was having the cutting brakes mounted on the stearing wheel, similarly to paddle shifters.</p>

                <h3>Differential Un-locker</h3>
                <p>The Differential Unlocker is used in conjunction
                with the cutting brakes as an "un-locker" for the gear box. When the cutting brakes are actuated, the differential unlocker simultaneously seperates the corresponding shaft from the gear box, allowing the outer wheel to roll freely. Its purpose is to ensure that the cutting brakes don’t grind and/or destroy the gears in the differential. The complexity in this design stemmed from the necessity to actuate the differential unlocker at exactly the correct time, independent of which direction the cutting brakes are being applied.</p>
